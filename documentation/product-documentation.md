Bezz AI – Product Specification
Product Definition (One Line)
Bezz AI is an AI-driven branding platform that can turn a simple five-minute founder input form into a full launch-ready brand – complete with strategy, name, visuals, and ad content, generated in minutes . It enables early-stage African entrepreneurs to skip expensive agencies and instantly produce professional branding assets for their startup.
Core Problem, Target Users & Value Proposition
Problem: Most early-stage African founders and small businesses struggle with branding due to high costs and limited expertise. Traditional branding agencies charge $5–20k, which is out of reach for these founders . As a result, new ventures often go to market with subpar branding or waste time piecing together logos, copy, and ads on their own.
Target Users: The primary users are early-stage African founders, SMEs, and micro-entrepreneurs who are tech-savvy but resource-constrained. There are an estimated 44 million MSMEs in sub-Saharan Africa, and even a tech-savvy subset (~2% of founders, ~44k users in year 1) represents a significant market . These users are typically mobile-first and operate in various local languages, so the platform must cater to multilingual needs (English, French, and key local languages) and work reliably in low-bandwidth environments .
Value Proposition: Bezz AI offers a leapfrogging solution by combining brand strategy generation + creative content production in one tool, something competitors do only partially . Founders can enter a few key facts about their business (name, industry, audience, etc.), and Bezz AI’s backend GPT agents will draft a brand positioning, ideal customer personas, taglines, and campaign angles, then instantly produce ready-to-use marketing assets (logos, social media ads, copy, etc.) tailored to that strategy – all in minutes, for free on the entry tier . This “5-minute to full brand” capability lets entrepreneurs launch with agency-quality branding without hiring experts or spending thousands. Paid tiers unlock higher-resolution assets, more content variety, collaboration features, and direct export to popular design/advertising platforms . In short, Bezz AI helps founders save money and time while achieving marketing-grade branding that can accelerate their go-to-market success.
V1 Features and Deliverables
The Version 1 (MVP) of Bezz AI will focus on the end-to-end flow from user input to downloadable brand assets. Key features and deliverables include:
Interactive Brand Questionnaire (Brief Form): A simple React web form where founders input their company name, sector/industry, target audience, desired tone/voice, and vision or tagline ideas. This ~5-minute form is the only input needed . The frontend guides the user with prompts (e.g. multiple-choice for tone, text fields for vision up to 280 characters).


AI-Generated Brand Brief: Upon submission, the system condenses the user’s inputs into a structured brand brief JSON (via a “Brief-GPT” agent). This brief includes key elements like the brand’s goal, defined audience, and tone of voice . (Example: Summarize inputs into {brand_goal, audience, tone, vision} in ~120 words.)


AI Brand Strategist Output: Using the brief, a second agent (“Strategist-GPT”) generates the branding strategy – including the product’s positioning statement, three ideal customer persona profiles (ICPs), a tagline, and a set of campaign angle ideas . This provides the messaging foundation for the brand. (The strategy is returned as structured data – e.g. JSON with personas, tagline, and a list of campaign angles.)


AI Creative Director Output: Next, a creative content agent (“Creative-Director-GPT”) produces the visual and marketing assets based on the strategy . Specifically, it will output:


Brand Name Suggestions: If the founder hasn’t finalized a brand name, the AI can suggest a compelling name.


Logo Concept & Color Palette: A text prompt for a logo and 2–3 suggested brand color hex codes that align with the brand’s vibe . (In V1 this will be a prompt description rather than a fully rendered logo, but it can be used with a design tool to generate a logo.)


Isit possible to deliver the pallette and logo in V1? Technically logo will go on final downloadable assets anyway. 


Three Static Ad Mockups: Three variations of ad copy and corresponding image prompts for social media ads . Each ad includes a headline (≤20 words) and body text tailored to the target audience, plus a generative image prompt or concept for the visual. (These will later be turned into actual images by the AI image generator.)


Short-Form Video Storyboard (Optional): A brief outline or script for a 15-second promotional video . This includes scene descriptions or key frames and suggested messaging. (Full video generation is an optional stretch goal; for V1 it may remain as a storyboard or concept due to technical complexity.)


Asset Generation Engine: The backend takes the Creative Director’s outputs and calls appropriate AI generation services to produce the actual media:


Image Generation: Use DALL·E 3 (OpenAI) or Stability SDXL to create the ad visuals based on the prompts . Three low-resolution images (one per ad concept) will be generated in the free tier. Higher tiers can request higher-resolution versions.


If we're staying in OpenAI we will use Image Gen, instead for images.


Logo Generation: For a logo prompt, if feasible, the system can call the image generator to produce a basic logo draft. (Alternatively, the prompt is given to the user to refine externally.)


(Optional) Video Clip Generation: If the short video storyboard feature is enabled, the system can integrate with a video generation service (e.g. Runway ML or Kling AI) to create a short animated video clip . This is experimental and may not be in the core MVP, but the architecture allows plugging in a video generator for the higher-tier “Studio” plan. All generated assets (images/videos) are saved to cloud storage.


Cloud Storage of Assets: Generated media files are stored in an S3-compatible storage bucket (Google Cloud Storage). Each asset is associated with the user’s session/brand project. This allows the user to download or re-access their assets anytime. Storage links are secured and have expiration/lifecycle rules (e.g. auto-delete unused trial assets after 30 days to save space) .


User Dashboard: After generation, the user is taken to a dashboard where they can preview and download all their branding assets. The dashboard will display the strategy output (textual brand brief and personas), the tagline, and the set of ads with their images and copy. Users can download images (PNG/JPEG) and copy text, or export assets in batch.


One-Click Exports & Integrations: To streamline marketing use, V1 will include basic integrations:


Export to Canva: e.g. a button that sends the generated images and text into a Canva template or provides a formatted file for easy editing in Canva .
If we want them to edit, the final output file will need to be a PNG file, not jpeg. 


Export to Meta Ads Manager: e.g. the ability to push the ad copy and image into a Facebook Ads draft via API/webhook .

 (These integrations may be rudimentary in V1 – possibly just downloadable formats or links – but the scaffolding will be in place for deeper integration.)


Localization (Language Support): V1 will be primarily in English, but by the end of the 8-week roadmap we plan to introduce French support for prompts and outputs . This means the AI can output ads and copy in French (important for Francophone African markets). The system is designed to later include other local languages via prompt localization.


Admin & Analytics (Basic): An admin interface (or admin view within the app) will be present in V1 to allow internal team members to view user submissions and generated outputs, primarily for content moderation and system monitoring. Additionally, basic metrics (number of briefs created, API usage, conversion to paid) will be collected for the team’s analysis (detailed admin features are outlined below in User Stories).


Deliverables Summary: By the end of V1, we expect to deliver a working web application where a founder can go from inputting their business idea to downloading a “mini brand kit” (brand brief, tagline, sample ads with images, and a logo concept) in one seamless flow. This MVP will validate core functionality – AI-generated branding – and set the stage for iterative improvements in quality and additional content types (e.g. polished logos, longer videos) in subsequent versions.
User Stories
For Founders (End Users):
As a founder, I want to quickly input my company’s basics (name, industry, audience, etc.) through a simple form so that I can get branding materials without a steep learning curve.


As a founder, I want the platform to generate a brand strategy (positioning, tagline, customer personas) for me so that I can understand how to market my business effectively, even if I don’t have marketing expertise.


As a founder, I want to instantly get a set of professional-looking ad creatives (image + copy) tailored to my business, so that I can start promoting on social media right away.


As a founder, I want to be able to preview and download all the assets (images and copy text) so that I can use them in my pitch deck, on social media, or on my website.


As a founder, I want an option to export or edit these assets in familiar tools (like Canva or Facebook Ads Manager) so that I can refine them or launch campaigns easily.


As a founder, I want to try this service for free initially (e.g. get a few sample ads and low-res images) so that I can judge its value, and then upgrade to a paid plan for more assets or higher quality if I find it useful.


For Admins (Platform Administrators):
As an admin, I want to monitor user activity (sign-ups, number of brand briefs created, API usage) so that I can track adoption and ensure the AI usage stays within cost limits.


As an admin, I want to view or audit the content generated by the AI (e.g. the brand briefs, ad copy, and images) so that I can moderate for any inappropriate or off-brand content and improve the system prompts if needed.


As an admin, I need the ability to adjust user entitlements (e.g. reset a user’s credits, upgrade/downgrade a plan, or ban abusive users) so that I can manage the platform’s usage and enforce fair use and content policies.


As an admin, I want to configure system settings and prompts (such as updating the AI system prompt templates or token limits) without deploying new code, so that I can tweak the AI’s behavior and guardrails in response to real-world usage.


As an admin, I want to see basic analytics dashboards (e.g. daily active users, conversion rate from free to paid, success rate of AI generations, etc.) so that I can report on our growth and identify any drop-off points in the user flow.


High-Level Technical Architecture (Prototype)
The Bezz AI prototype will follow a modern web SaaS architecture with a React frontend, a Go backend API, cloud-based storage, and external AI services. The design is guided by the MVP scaffolding from the “Intelligence Bible” document, with some tech stack substitutions (Go for Python) for performance and familiarity. The architecture is summarized as follows:
Frontend: A React single-page application (SPA) built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS for a responsive, mobile-friendly UI. This app handles the interactive form (brand questionnaire), displays the AI outputs (text and images on the dashboard), and manages user authentication state. The React app will be bootstrapped possibly with Vite for fast dev and uses context/state management to store the user’s brand brief and results.


Authentication & User Management: We use Firebase Authentication for quick integration of secure sign-up/login (supporting email/password and social login if needed). Firebase Auth provides JWT tokens that the frontend will include in API requests. This way, the Go backend can verify tokens to authenticate users. User profiles (UID, email, plan tier, etc.) are managed by Firebase. This choice accelerates development; later we can migrate to a self-hosted auth like Keycloak for more advanced user management. (Firebase also offers easy integration with Google identity and others out of the box.)


Backend: A Go API server (e.g. using Go Fiber or Gin framework) will serve as the core application server. It exposes RESTful endpoints (or GraphQL endpoints) for:


Submitting the Brand Brief: Endpoint to accept the form data (company info) and initiate the AI generation workflow.


Polling/Fetching Results: Endpoints for the frontend to retrieve the status or results of generation (if we do async jobs for generation).


Admin Operations: Endpoints restricted to admin JWTs for listing users, reviewing content, etc. (could be minimal in MVP).


The backend orchestrates calls to the AI services and handles business logic:


It receives the form data, stores it (in a database or in-memory cache), and sends it to the OpenAI GPT-4 API for the Brief-GPT step.


It then calls GPT-4 again (or another completion) for the Strategist-GPT step using the brief summary.


Next, it calls GPT-4 once more for the Creative-Director-GPT step to get ad copy and image prompts .


For each image prompt, it calls the DALL·E 3 API (or Stability AI’s SDXL API) to generate the actual image file . These calls happen asynchronously or sequentially.


(Optional) If video generation is enabled, the backend calls the Runway ML API or Kling for video creation using the storyboard. This might be done as a background task due to longer processing time.


The backend then stores the resulting media files (images/video) in cloud storage and saves references (URLs/paths) along with the strategy JSON and copy text in the database.


We choose Go for the backend for its efficiency and strong support for concurrency (useful when making multiple external API calls concurrently, e.g. generating 3 ads in parallel). The backend will be containerized via Docker.


Database/Storage: For the MVP, we can utilize Firebase’s Cloud Firestore as a quick datastore for user data and briefs (leveraging our Firebase integration). The brief inputs and AI outputs (strategy JSON, ads JSON) can be stored as documents keyed by user ID or session. This avoids setting up a separate database in the very early stage. However, we plan to migrate to PostgreSQL in later versions for more robust relational data management (especially as data complexity grows – e.g. multiple brand projects per user, usage tracking, billing records). The initial code structure can abstract the data access so that swapping in PostgreSQL is straightforward (indeed, the provided scaffold already envisioned a Postgres DB for storing briefs ). We will also use a small in-memory cache (or Redis if needed) for caching results and handling job state (for example, caching a GPT response for reuse).


Asset Storage: Generated images (and videos) are stored in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket, configured with S3 interoperability (so we treat it like S3) . Each file will have a unique key (e.g. containing userID/brandID). The backend will generate pre-signed URLs for the frontend to download the assets securely. As a guardrail, we set lifecycle rules so that unused or trial-generated assets auto-delete after 30 days to manage storage costs .


AI Services Integration: All AI-heavy tasks are done via external APIs:


OpenAI GPT-4 (or GPT-4 advanced model gpt-4o as noted in the scaffold) is used for text generation – this includes summarizing the brief and generating strategy and ad copy . System prompts are carefully designed for each stage to ensure outputs are structured (see Guardrails below).


Image Generation is done via OpenAI’s DALL·E 3 (for quality and ease) during the MVP . As an alternative or cost-saving measure, we can integrate Stability AI’s SDXL model via their API or a hosted inference if needed. (In MVP we will use whichever provides better quality and reliability; DALL·E 3 is presumed.)


Video Generation (if included) will use Runway ML (e.g. their Gen-2 model API) or Kling (an AI video generator) as external services. Given the experimental nature, this will likely be behind a feature flag or only enabled for certain admin tests or Studio-tier users initially.


These external calls require API keys and will incur usage costs. The backend will implement rate limiting and batching to keep calls within allowed quotas.


Hosting & Deployment: We will containerize the web app and server using Docker. The preferred hosting is on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for synergy with Firebase and GCS:


The frontend can be a static bundle served via a CDN or Firebase Hosting.


The Go backend can run on Cloud Run (serverless containers) or GKE (Kubernetes) depending on scale needs. Cloud Run is likely sufficient for the MVP, auto-scaling instances based on demand.


We will use GCP services for environment secrets (storing API keys), and monitoring/logging via Stackdriver.


For CI/CD, GitHub Actions or Cloud Build will be set up to test and deploy the Docker images on push.


Future Scalability (PostgreSQL & Keycloak): While the MVP prioritizes speed using Firebase, we plan for an easy transition to more scalable components:


Move from Firestore to PostgreSQL: The codebase will include data models (as seen in the scaffold) that can map to a SQL database . We can introduce a PostgreSQL instance (e.g. Cloud SQL) when we need advanced queries or to ensure data consistency across services. Postgres will allow robust relational mappings (e.g. users, brands, assets, payments) and easier analytics via SQL.


Move from Firebase Auth to Keycloak (or another OAuth2 identity server): For enterprise or on-prem deployments and more flexible role management, Keycloak could replace Firebase. In that scenario, the React app would use Keycloak for SSO/OAuth, and the backend would validate Keycloak tokens. This swap can happen once the user base grows and if we need features like organization accounts, custom roles/permissions, or integration with enterprise SSO providers.


Use of Redis or a message queue (like Google Pub/Sub) might be introduced later to handle job queueing (especially if many simultaneous image generations) and to decouple long-running tasks.


Overall, the architecture is modular: the frontend, backend, and AI services are decoupled via clear API interfaces (e.g., the backend doesn’t assume which model is used – it could switch from OpenAI to another model provider with minimal changes). The initial stack (React + Firebase Auth + Go API + OpenAI + GCS) aligns with the reference design , ensuring we have a solid foundation to build on and replace components as needed.
Monetization Model & Tiered Paywall
Bezz AI will adopt a freemium model with tiered subscriptions and a credit-based usage limit for the free tier. This approach ensures accessibility for new users and a path to revenue from power users. The planned tiers (as initially conceived in the concept sheet) are:
Free Tier: $0/month. For new and trial users. Includes 1 brand project (brief) with up to 3 generated ads (images are low-resolution and watermarked) . This tier lets every user experience the core value for free, ensuring 100% sign-up conversion to trying the product . Usage limits: Free users will get a certain number of credits representing generations (e.g. enough credits to generate those 3 ads and one brief). The watermark on images and limited output encourage users to upgrade for full-quality assets.


Pro Tier: $15/month. For individual founders or small teams who need more branding power. Includes up to 3 brand projects, high-resolution asset downloads (no watermarks), and export integrations (direct to Canva, Facebook Ads) enabled . This tier offers substantially more value and is priced affordably for startups. Expected to convert ~6% of free users to paid . Usage limits: Pro users have a higher credit allotment (or essentially “unlimited” within fair use) for generating assets, but we may enforce reasonable monthly limits (to prevent abuse, e.g. 100 images/month).


Studio Tier: $49/month. For power users or agencies (or more established startups). Includes unlimited brands, multi-user collaboration (several team member accounts), HD video generation, and the ability to fine-tune the AI with a custom brand voice or guidelines . This is a premium offering targeted at the top 1% of users (those who need extensive content) . It might also include priority support or faster generation times. Usage limits: Virtually unlimited generation, within an acceptable use policy (the system may still throttle extremely heavy use).


All payments will be handled via an integrated paywall. For MVP, we will implement this using Stripe and Kowri for card payments (and plan to integrate mobile money (M-Pesa, MoMo) for local subscribers, given the importance in Africa) . In practice, the paywall will work as follows:
Users sign up and start on the Free tier by default. No card is required to try the free features.


When a user attempts an action beyond their free limits (e.g. generating a 4th ad or downloading a high-res version), they are prompted to upgrade to Pro (or Studio).


The upgrade flow will use Stripe Checkout or a billing portal to collect payment and subscribe the user to a plan. Firebase Auth can be extended with custom claims or Firestore entries to mark the user’s plan (“free”, “pro”, “studio”).


The backend will check the user’s plan (from a token claim or DB) and enforce limits accordingly. For example, an API call to generate an asset will return an error or prompt if the user exceeded their quota for the month on the free plan.


Credit-Based Tracking: Even on free tier, we implement a credit system to monitor usage. Each content generation (e.g. one image or one campaign output) will deduct credits from the user’s free balance. This enables features like:
Free Trial Credits: New users might get a certain number of credits (e.g. enough for 1 full brand kit generation). We track their consumption; once exhausted, further generations require an upgrade.


Referral Rewards: We can award bonus credits for actions like referring a friend. (The concept sheet suggests a growth loop: “Share Bloom (Bezz) and earn 30 extra design credits.” which we will implement to spur word-of-mouth growth.)


Paid Credits: In the future, aside from subscriptions, we could allow purchasing one-off credit packs (for users who prefer pay-as-you-go usage instead of a subscription).


The paywall will be implemented in a tiered access manner: the UI will show what’s included in each tier and gracefully restrict features. For instance, the download button for high-res images might be locked with a tooltip “Upgrade to Pro to download without watermark.” The system will also incorporate a free trial counter – e.g. display “You have 2 of 3 free designs remaining” to encourage mindful usage and upsell when nearing the limit.
Finally, the revenue model expects a large top-of-funnel on free and a smaller conversion to paid. Based on projections, with aggressive outreach we target ~70k signups in first year, converting ~6% to Pro and ~1% to Studio, which could yield a healthy ARR around $1M . The tiered model is essential to cater to the broad base of users (freemium for accessibility) while monetizing the most active users sustainably.
GPT Agent Guardrails & System Prompts
Because Bezz AI relies heavily on generative AI (GPT-4, etc.), we will put strong guardrails in place to ensure the outputs are relevant, safe, and cost-effective:
Structured System Prompts: We design each AI agent with a carefully crafted system prompt to constrain its output format and domain. For example:


Brief-GPT is instructed: “You are Brief-GPT. Condense founder inputs into a JSON brief with keys: brand_goal, audience, tone, vision.” . This guarantees the first step returns a machine-readable summary.


Strategist-GPT prompt: “Given {summary}, craft positioning, 3 ICP personas, tagline, campaign angles (table).” – telling the model exactly which elements to return .


Creative-Director-GPT prompt: “Using {strategy}, output JSON array of 3 ads with headline (≤20 words), body, dalle_prompt.” . This forces the model to output a fixed number of ads with specified fields, ensuring we can parse and use them.


By locking down format and scope in system messages, we reduce the chance of the AI going off-track. Each agent focuses on its role (brief summarization, strategy, or creative) and returns consistent JSON outputs that our backend can parse. This also helps with cost control by limiting response length (e.g. ≤120 words for brief) and focusing the token usage .


Content Moderation: We will employ OpenAI’s content moderation API (or equivalent filters) on user inputs and AI outputs. This means if a user tries to input disallowed content (hate speech, etc.), or if the AI’s output inadvertently includes sensitive or unsafe content, we catch it before presenting it. In such cases, the app might show an error or a sanitized response. This protects both the users and us (especially given potential regulatory concerns around AI-generated content in Africa ).


Token & Rate Limits: To manage costs, each user is subject to a token budget per day and each API route is rate-limited:


For example, a free user may be limited to ~5 GPT-4 calls per day (which aligns with generating one full brand kit) and a certain number of image generations. Pro/Studio users get higher limits but still within reason. The backend will enforce these and queue or reject requests beyond the limit .


We also throttle by IP or account to prevent abuse (e.g. a script hitting our API repeatedly) . This is especially crucial for the free tier which could be targeted by heavy users trying to game the system.


Caching and Retries: The system caches the results of AI calls whenever possible. If a user resubmits the same brief (or if a step fails and needs retry), the backend can return the cached response to avoid double-billing tokens . We will hash the input brief and store the resulting strategy and ads for a short period. Similarly, if generation fails due to an AI error or network issue, we handle it gracefully: either automatically retry once, or return a friendly error and allow the user to retry without consuming extra credits.


Post-Processing & Validation: After AI returns results, the backend performs sanity checks. For example, ensure the JSON can be parsed. If an expected field is missing (say the AI didn’t follow format), we can have a fallback prompt or logic to fix it (or at least not crash the app). For image prompts, we might append certain terms to improve quality or safety (like ensuring the prompt doesn’t violate content rules of DALL·E). In copy, we might run a spelling/grammar check or make minor tweaks (via a smaller model) to ensure professionalism.


User Safeguards: We will clearly label AI-generated content and caution users that they should review everything before using it publicly. This is a soft guardrail but important for setting expectations. Additionally, any potential IP issues (like the fact that AI-generated logos might be similar to existing ones, etc.) will be communicated, and the platform will provide guidance that final logos/trademarks should be vetted.


Data Privacy: All user inputs and AI outputs are kept confidential. We don’t use them to further train models without permission. This will be stated in our privacy policy, which is especially crucial to gain trust among users who might be sharing novel business ideas.


By implementing these guardrails, we aim to ensure that Bezz AI’s agents remain relevant, reliable, and safe. Early testing (possibly with a closed beta) will be used to refine these prompts and limits. Our design already accounts for controlling cost and misuse (token limits, rate limiting, auto-deletion of old assets) which will keep the platform sustainable .
Development Roadmap – First 8 Weeks
The following is a week-by-week plan to build and launch the Bezz AI MVP (approximately 2 months of development) :
Week 1 – Setup Auth & Payments: Implement Firebase Authentication (user sign-up/login UI in React, link to Firebase). Set up Stripe integration (or dummy payment) for the upgrade workflow. Basic user model (free vs paid flag) in Firestore. Outcome: Users can create accounts and we have a way to record payments (even if manual at this stage) .


Week 2 – Brand Brief Intake Form: Develop the brief intake form on the frontend with all required fields (company name, sector dropdown, tone options, etc.). Define the JSON schema for the brief (keys: brand_goal, audience, tone, vision) and ensure the frontend sends this to the backend. Create a placeholder API in Go that accepts this and returns a dummy response (for now) to test end-to-end flow .


Week 3 – Integrate GPT for Brief & Strategy: Connect the backend to OpenAI API. Implement the Brief-GPT call to summarize user input into a brief JSON, and the Strategist-GPT call to produce positioning, personas, tagline, and campaign angles . Store these results in the database. Frontend: display the strategy output nicely on a results page (text content).


Week 4 – Creative Director & Ad Generation: Implement the Creative-Director GPT step to generate ad copy and image prompts . Then integrate DALL·E 3 API to generate the actual ad images from those prompts. Backend now orchestrates full workflow (brief -> strategy -> ads -> image URLs). Frontend: create a gallery or section to show the three ad images with their copy. Also, implement image storage in GCS and retrieve URLs. By end of week, a user can go from input to seeing AI-generated ads (low-res) on the dashboard .


Week 5 – Dashboard & Downloads: Polish the user dashboard page. Ensure users can download their images (e.g. a download button for each, which pulls from the GCS link). If needed, generate a PDF or zip containing the brief, strategy, and ads as a mini brand report. Add the ability to create a new brief (and store multiple briefs per user in DB). Outcome: The app feels complete — users can input, get outputs, and retrieve assets .


Week 6 – Export Integrations: Implement the promised integrations: e.g., Canva export – this could be as simple as preparing a Canva design link or using Canva’s API to populate a template. Meta Ads export – possibly generate a CSV or use the Facebook Ads API if time permits. At minimum, provide guidance or a one-click action that gets users’ content into those platforms. Also, incorporate any necessary webhooks or backend logic for these exports .


Week 7 – Localization & Throttling: Add support for French language generation. This likely involves translating the system prompts and allowing user input in French, then calling GPT with French instructions. We might also need to use a French language model variant or just rely on GPT-4’s multilingual ability . In parallel, implement token usage tracking and throttling: e.g., count tokens per user in each request, store it, and block or warn if daily limit exceeded (especially for free users). This is also the time to finalize any guardrails configurations (fine-tune prompts, content filters) based on testing feedback.


Week 8 – Testing & Beta Launch: Conduct a “smoke-test” launch – release the beta to a small group or via a waitlist invite. Monitor key metrics: ensure the cost per generation is within expectations, track any critical bugs or crashes. Set up analytics dashboards for signups, conversion, and engagement (could use Firebase Analytics or simple scripts). This week is about bug-fixing, UX polish, and deploying the stable version on GCP. By end of week 8, we aim to have ~100+ beta users on the platform and measure CPC and signup rates from any pilot marketing campaigns .


Each week’s milestones are derived from the MVP scaffold and are designed to build iteratively – delivering a usable product as early as possible and refining it. After week 8, assuming metrics are positive, we will plan the next phase with improvements (e.g. better logo generation, adding a template library, scaling infrastructure, marketing push, etc.). For now, this 8-week roadmap focuses on delivering a functional prototype of Bezz AI that can be tested with real founders, demonstrating the core value of AI-driven branding.
